            For calculating peak power at currents, I found the slope of the
            line representing the relationship between RPM and current. Using
            this, I found the RPM the motor would be spinning at if drawing the
            given current at 12 volts. Then, since{" "}
            <code>power = kT * current * rpm</code>, we can easily find the
            power generated. As for the power:weight ratio, I used either the
            max theoretical power of the motor, or the peak power at 50A,
            whichever was lower (since not all motors can survive 50A).

            These are constants that are intrinsic to the physical construction
            of the motor. <code>kT</code> defines the relationship between
            current applied and torque output. It can be used to calculate the
            power output of a motor given a speed and current. This is useful to
            as as FRC robots are often current-limited. <code>kV</code> is the
            inverse of <code>kT</code>, and can also be defined as the RPM of
            the motor per volt applied.

            Generally a metric not used in robot design, but is useful to know
            when calculating other properties of the motor. Generally, a lower
            internal resistance will result in a motor that draws less current
            for a given amount of power compared to one with a higher internal
            resistance.
